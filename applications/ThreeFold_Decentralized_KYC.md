- **Project Name:** ThreeFold Decentralised KYC

- **Payment Address:** x BTC / USD / ... 
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 3

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

ThreeFold Tech has developed technology to empower a global scalable peer2peer Internet. This open-source peer-to-peer Internet empowers the digital workloads of tomorrow. Our vision is of a digital economy that guarantees data sovereignty, privacy and ownership for all, delivers equality regardless of borders, gender or race and is based upon an infrastructure that is truly decentralised, ecologically and economically sustainable for our beautiful planet. Doing good for the world and growing a successful software company can go hand in hand. 
Our peer-to-peer internet technology is a blockchain-driven, self-healing cloud storage, compute and network platform. Addressing multiple target groups (e.g. blockchain organisations, developer community, banking, telco operators, government, enterprise etc) and enabling sustainable cloud infrastructure that is decentralised, quantum safe, scalable,  self-healing, regenerative and ultra cost-effective. 
ThreeFold Grid now in 3e generation, our primary use case, is live today with 90+ PB of storage and 31k+ CPU cores available across 60 countries and growing day-to-day. ThreeFold Grid has attracted 20+ fantastic partners who are building added value on this universal network of decentralised capacity.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

The project already has TFChain running as the blockchain component of the project. TFChain is running in Parity Substrate. 
It is the trust component which, combined with the Zero-OS operating system, the Quantum-Safe Storage and the Planetary Network, is the foundation of the peer-to-peer internet. Anyone requiring internet capacity for deploying his workloads can make use of decentralised capacity connected to the Threefold Grid. 

To our knowledge, a truly Decentralised and Autonomous Internet infrastructure platform has never been created, not in the Substrate ecosystem, but neither anywhere else. Traditionally, information technology is very people-intensive which adds to its complexity, risk and cost. Our technology approach is unique in many aspects including a fully decentralised operating system able to federate any digital network, compute and storage infrastructure, quantum safe storage, planetary network, carbon-negative sustainability, significant cost efficiency etc.

The project brings true decentralisation and brings back the internet to a state that is in line with how it was started. Over the years, internet has been monopolized by big tech hyperscalers, which have abused their power to their own financial benefit.  

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
